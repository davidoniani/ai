% Derivation

Linear function: \(f(x) = xW + b\).
\\\\
Logistic Regression function: \(\text{Sigmoid}(f(x))\).
\\\\
Log-loss: \(-(y\log{f(x)} + (1 - y)\log{(1 - f(x))})\)
\\\\
Mean Log-loss: \(\text{mean}(-(y\log{f(x)} + (1 - y)\log{(1 - f(x))}))\)
\\\\
Recall the following:
\begin{equation}
    \text{Sigmoid}(x)' = \Big(\dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\Big)' = \text{Sigmoid}(x)(1 - \text{Sigmoid}(x))
\end{equation}

We now calculate partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to weights and a bias.
\\\\
Let $h = \text{Sigmoid}(f(x))$.
\\\\
We have:
\begin{align}
    (-(y\log{h} + (1 - y)\log{(1 - h)}))' &= -\frac{y}{h} \times h' - \frac{1 - y}{1 - h} \times (-h')\\
                                          &= h'* \frac{(1 - y)h - y(1 - h)}{h(1 - h)}\\
                                          &= h(1 - h)f'(x) \times \frac{(1 - y)h - y(1 - h)}{h(1 - h)}\\
                                          &= f'(x) \times (h - y)\\
                                          &= (xW + b)' \times (h - y)
\end{align}

Then the derivative w.r.t. $W$ is

\begin{equation}
    \boxed{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 0}^n x \cdot (\text{Sigmoid}(f(x_i)) - y_i)}
\end{equation}

and the derivative w.r.t. $b$ is

\begin{equation}
    \boxed{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 0}^n \text{Sigmoid}(f(x_i)) - y_i}
\end{equation}
